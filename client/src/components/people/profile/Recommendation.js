          <p>Boris Paskalev working with me on a thesis project using truck navigational and real-time wireless communication to demonstrate new models of doing business for the United States Postal Service. <br/>Boris was a standout MIT student creating a huge concept vehicle in such a short amount of time. He works independently and can build anything (mechanical, electrical, computer program). When a deadline is upon him He will work all night in the rain and can even enlist his girlfriend to help too!. </p>

        <Col>
          <p>He works collaboratively and loves to take direction towards a commonly agreed on goal He presents clearly. He treats people with respect and is inclusive. <br/>Boris was astounding at sourcing everything we needed, writing the code and making it happen. Boris is a master of procurement and responsible with money as well. My understanding is that he did not even compromise his other classes, social life or personal balance in doing the work. </p>

          <p>If I havenâ€™t been clear enough, Boris has my highest recommendation as an engineer or scientist. He has the creativity and follows through to visualize, build test and present ideas in a shortest time of any student you will find. This is a very very special guy.</p>
